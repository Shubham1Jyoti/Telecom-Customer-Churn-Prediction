The analysis of the telecom customer churn dataset reveals several key insights into customer behavior and revenue potential. With 5,880 customers studied, a notable segment includes 777 senior citizen males and 718 senior citizen females actively using phone services. Contract analysis shows that month-to-month contracts yield the highest average monthly charges at Rs 142,815.51, followed by Rs 136,966.11 for one-year contracts and Rs 132,746.12 for two-year contracts, each promising a 20% profit margin. Payment method usage is diverse, with significant numbers across bank transfers, credit cards, electronic checks, and mailed checks, with variations observed between genders.
Profitability insights highlight bank transfers and electronic checks as lucrative revenue streams, assuming a 20% profit margin. Customer service configurations, such as internet service types and additional features like online backup and device protection, reveal distinct usage patterns that influence customer preferences and behaviors.
Identifying top and bottom customers based on monthly charges provides clarity on customer value and profit potential. Furthermore, tenure and churn data emphasize the need for targeted retention strategies, particularly for customers on shorter contracts, to minimize churn rates and stabilize revenue. Overall, the findings underscore opportunities for optimizing revenue through strategic contract management and tailored customer retention initiatives in the telecommunications sector.
